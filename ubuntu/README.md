# Portable Installation

I had a couple of issues with creating a portable installation of Ubuntu onto an external drive:
- The installation process caused unwanted changes to the Windows boot configuration on the system I used to set up the external drive.
- The Ubuntu install created depended on the boot configuration of the Windows system to work, it was not portable between systems.

I used the following article to get it working eventually. It explicitly addresses the issues I had.
